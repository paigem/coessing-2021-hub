# Python notebooks for COESSING 2021!

All Python labs for COESSING 2021 can be found in this repository. These notebooks are all created to run on the COESSING JupyterHub, generously set up and sponsored by [2i2c](https://2i2c.org). 

**Note: the dedicated COESSING JupyterHub has been taken down, but all COESSING users are able to access the Pangeo Cloud. For instructions, please check the #python-2021 Slack channel or contact [Paige Martin](mailto:pmartin@ldeo.columbia.edu).**

The JupyterHub can be accessed by clicking on the button below. Note that you need to be an authorized user to access this Hub. Instructions on how to become an authorized user can be found in the COESSING 2021 schedule document.
